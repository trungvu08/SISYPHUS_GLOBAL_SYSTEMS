## &#128221; CFC Project Summary

### Long Description:
Beginning with Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the National Flood Insurance Program  (NFIP) has struggled with financial insolvency. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the NFIP is expected to lose an annual $1.4 billion for the foreseeable future. The growing frequency and mounting economic costs of larger flooding events in the time of heightened climate change, rapid urbanization,  environmental degradation, and rising sea levels have only exacerbated this issue. But also, flooding has disproportionate impacts on human society. Populations in socially, economically, and geographically vulnerable areas experience most of  the flood burdens and minimum mitigation benefits. Within the historical context, centuries of slavery exploitation, several decades of Jim Crow domination, thirty years of civil rights oppression, recent flood disasters displacement and gentrification have defined the systemicly racist settlement patterns of New Orleans and the development of most American cities. Consequently, the wealthy majority have historically had rights to the geologically high-lying areas, while the lower-income, primarily minority, were delegated to settle in the low-lying areas  with greater flood risk and less flood protection. At the international scale, greenhouse  gases produced by wealthier countries will disproportionately affect the ill-equipped global south from mitigating the climate crisis. Our Global Challenge will be to address these environmental justice and  equity issues by developing an interactive web portal that calculates the flood risk  of individual property and its optimal flood mitigation from a GIS database of the  pilot city of New Orleans, which is one of the most hazard-prone urban cities in the  world. A leading-edge AR interface will innovatively communicate the needed  information to help professionals, officials, and residents make better-informed  decisions for self-determination within an environmental justice and equity  framework. The GIS database uses a geographically weighted regression model  to produce a local spatial model of the latent factors of structural racism by fitting  a regression equation to every map layer (e.g., gray/green infrastructure, flood  hazard and risk, socioeconomic vulnerability, etc.). The map overlay methodology  is a visual tool to display complex spatial data patterns of flood risk and mitigation  in a concise understandable manner. This new AR communication medium will be  able to simply present the interaction of the many different cost-benefit analyses.  Ultimately, the web tool will enhance the city's resiliency and adaptability. By  globally scaling IBM open-source technology, we hope to confront the social  and humanitarian issues in the global south and other regions of the world that are  disproportionately affected by climate change. An understanding of these underlying  causes of environmental injustice and inequity will help us tailor the XR human  experience to effectively inform flood risk and mitigation to diverse social, economic, political, environmental, cultural, and geographical factors. Without these direct technique interventions, the unequal distribution of the burden of flood  risk and benefit of flood mitigation will be most felt on the national scale by Indigenous, brown, and Black Americans and on the larger scale, will amplify these  environmental injustices and equities in the global south.

## &#128187; To Run our Hackathon Code
Our ultimate aim is to conduct a geographically weighted regression to predict flood risk for individual properties in New Orleans (at present) and scale to support different locations eventually. The final user experience will entail users being able to zoom into a flood risk map to their property and get an individualized risk assessment and cost ebenfit analysis. We are working with data from the pilot city of New Orleans and one of the back-end development tasks in this project is to generate maps of different variabels that will be used in the regression. For the hackathon, we are submitting a web app that shows two of the feature layers we generated using the ArcGIS platform and javascript API. We are vizualising green (orange dots) and gray (purple pipeline) infrastructure in New Orleans, which are important predictors of potential flooding risk.
