## &#128221; CFC Project Summary

### Long Description:
Beginning with Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the National Flood Insurance Program
(NFIP) has struggled with financial insolvency. The Congressional Budget Office
estimated that the NFIP is expected to lose an annual $1.4 billion for the
foreseeable future. The growing frequency and mounting economic costs of larger
flooding events in the time of heightened climate change, rapid urbanization,
environmental degradation, and rising sea levels have only exacerbated this issue.
But also, flooding has disproportional impacts on human society. Population in
socially, economically, and geographically vulnerable areas experience most of
the flood burdens and minimum mitigation benefits. Within the historical context,
through centuries of slavery exploitation, several decades of Jim Crow domination,
thirty years of civil rights oppression, recent flood disasters displacement, and
gentrification has defined the settlement pattern of New Orleans and the
development of the American cities. Consequently, the wealthy majority residents

have historically had rights to the geologic high-lying areas, while the lower-
income, primarily minority residents were delegated to settle in the low-lying areas

with greater flood risk and less flood protection. At the international scale, the
global south is disproportionately affected and is unequipped to mitigate the
climate crisis, while the wealthier counties which produce most of the greenhouse
gases. Our Global Challenge will be to address these environmental justice and
equity issues by developing an interactive web portal that calculates the flood risk
of individual property and its optimal flood mitigation from a GIS database of the
pilot city of New Orleans, which is one of the most hazard-prone urban cities in the
world. A leading-edge AR interface will innovatively communicate the needed
information to helping professionals, officials, and residents make better-informed
decisions for self-determination within an environmental justice and equity
framework. The GIS database uses a geographically weighted regressions model
to produce a local spatial model of the latent factors of structural racism by fitting
a regression equation to every map layer (e.g., gray/green infrastructure, flood
hazard and risk, socioeconomic vulnerability, etc.). The map overlay methodology
is a visual tool to display complex spatial data patterns of flood risk and mitigation
in a concise understandable manner. This new AR communication medium will be
able to simply present the interaction of the many different cost-benefit analyses.
Ultimately, the web tool will enhance the city's resiliency and adaptability. By
globally scaling the IBM open-source technology, we hope to confront the social
and humanitarian issues in the global south and other regions of the world that are
disproportionally affected by climate change. An understanding of these underlying
causes of environmental injustice and inequity will help us tailor the XR human
experience to effectively inform flood risk and mitigation to diverse social,
economic, political, environmental, cultural, and geographical factors. Without

these direct technique interventions, the unequal distribution of the burden of flood
risk and benefit of flood mitigation will be most felt on the national scale by
indigenous, brown, and black Americans and on the larger scale, will amplify these
environmental injustices and equities in the global south.
